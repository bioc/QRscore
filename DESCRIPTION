Description: In genomics, differential analysis enables the discovery of groups of genes implicating important biological processes such as cell differentiation and aging. Current non-parametric tests of differential gene expression are limited by their diminished power against alternatives characterized by shifts in spread (such as variance) rather than measures of centrality (such as mean or median). This package provides a flexible family of non-parametric two-sample tests and K-sample tests, which is based on theoretical work demonstrating the connection between widely used non-parametric tests and spacing statistics (Erdmann-Pham et al., 2022+).
